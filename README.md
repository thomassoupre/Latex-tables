# Latex-tables
 This project is made as an hobby. It's entirely made in python 2.7.
 It's all about transforming data files in the format of
 `[VALUES[\t| ]*]\n`
 into a LaTeX table. It's using the *multirow* package as needed by the data.

 Please use the *-h* option to get help. Feel free to try on the *test* data.
